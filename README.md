Backend Engineer

TypeScript mainly. Java, Python, PHP, Ruby when necessary. C++ when I'm feeling masochistic.

5 years in security sector: video management, access control. I can watch you fumble your keycard and remotely lock you out while you're getting coffee. Job perks.

Believer in boring technology, interesting problems, and the radical idea that logs should actually help debug things.

P.S. I encrypt all my secrets with double ROT13. Nobody but me can read them.
